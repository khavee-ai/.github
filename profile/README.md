# 🎭 Khavee AI
### Giving Digital Humans a Soul, a Voice, and a Dimension.

Welcome to the home of the **Khavee AI SDK**. We build the bridge between Large Language Models and the 3rd Dimension. Our mission is to make interactive, lifelike 3D avatars accessible to every React developer.

## 🛠 The Khavee Ecosystem

## ✨ Why Khavee?

We solve the "Uncanny Valley" problem by synchronizing three distinct layers of AI interaction:

* **🧠 The Brain:** Integrated RAG support and function calling to make your avatars smart.
* **🗣️ The Voice:** Sub-millisecond lip-sync via MFCC phoneme detection and WebRTC.
* **💃 The Body:** Automatic animation remapping and procedurally generated blinking and gestures.
